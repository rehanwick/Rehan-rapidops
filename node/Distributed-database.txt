distributed database - they are the database that they are stroedin the muslitible server called node/instance 

Advantages of distributed database - 
    1. Resilience and Reduse-Risk :- multiple replicas are stroed on the diffrent instance if one goes down due
        to ( Power-off , error , mentanace  ) 

    2. Easier to scale : - non DD is expensive to scale need more computing power to solve all the data base 

    3. geographically distributing the database can reduce latency


Distributed database configurations:
     1. active-passive :- In this all the read write operation is taking place on the single node then copyed to 
                         the other node , data is replicated asynchronusly 
                         Draw-back :- - All the computation is done on the single node 
                                      - Problem in Copying data to passive node
                                      - Online off-line Problem
     
     2. active-active :- In the active-active the traffic is routed to all of them 
                         Draw-back :- -difficult to setup 
                                      -DIffrent value of the same if anyone goes off
                                        
     3. multi-active :-
